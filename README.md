# zombi-demo
A code demo of aumanoid AI using Unity 3D in C#. HumanoidHandler switches animations and states when hunting and attacking humans.

The HumanoidHandler class can be found here:
https://github.com/jkcavin1/zombi-demo/blob/master/Assets/My%20Assets/HumanoidHandler.cs
I'd post this by itself, but if you wanted to tweack the code yourself, it relies on models and animations being present.


You can download the executable here:

It's not playable. It demonstrates the AI which inherently entails the computer making decision.
